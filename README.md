Data Analysis is all about finding patterns and insights about data. Humans are intuitively data analysts navigating through the world of complex patterns and impossibly impeccable regularities.

Humans, a part of the complex pattern of the world, have patterns themselves. Intricate patterns of thoughts, feelings, actions and reactions to different stimuli. These patterns comprise "Personality".

Psychologists through years of research have devised "The Big Five Personality Traits" to describe the broad range of patterns that serve as building blocks of personality. Whilst there is an extensive study into each area, researchers donâ€™t always agree on the definition of each characteristic. You see We, humans, are very intricately knotted patterns, difficult to unravel, a tiny product of the mighty universe, full of surprises.

Here, we try to squeeze out as much information as we can from the data available to us from a survey conducted in 2018.
